# PainPal App

new flutter project targeted for people with chronic migraine.
basing on a calendar view, painpal allows you to enter/select today's symptoms and other accompanying characteristics
in other screens, painpal displays today's atmospheric pressure in chosen location and informs whether its favorable or not
final screen shows statistics collected from minimum of 2 weeks of data
